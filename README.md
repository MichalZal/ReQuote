# ReQuote
## ReQuote is app, where you can add quotes, view them in full screen and add the comments to them.

## This app is build with reactjs and react-router-dom. You can view and add quotes. They are stored in database, so and you can add your own. 

### While doing it I learned and get more comfortable with: 
-Reactjs
-React-router-dom
-hooks
-custom hooks
-sending api request

## 14th July. Upgraded to react-router-dom version 6. 

To use it, first downlonad the code, use ```npm i``` to install dependencies. 
Then create own backend in firebase and open realtime database. Paste the url into the custom hook URL variable, and the app is ready to go.
